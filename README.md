# Phone-Emulator
This project was the mid term project for my Applications Programming class and had us implement more complicated aspects such as dynamically creating UI elements. There were several extra options I had the choice of adding to my project, of those I decided to include a special case when calling an emergency number. I also added a feature to save the top most frequently called numbers in a separate list that the user can select. Along with this the application can read a list of contacts from a file and list them on the side as can be seen. When selecting a name from this list it will load in the contacts number to be called. Entering a number will start sorting the list by potential contact matches by number and then by possible name from the character representations of each number. Overall this project ended up pretty well for me.
